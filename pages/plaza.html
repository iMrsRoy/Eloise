1) Padding is only placed on the top and/or bottom of the divs. The elements within these divs have padding on their sides. This saves you from any "box model math". Keep in mind, if you add any side padding or border to the div itself, it will be added to the width you define to create the *total* width. You may also choose to remove the padding on the element in the div and place a second div within it with no width and the padding necessary for your design.

2) No margin has been given to the columns since they are all floated. If you must add margin, avoid placing it on the side you're floating toward (for example: a right margin on a div set to float right). Many times, padding can be used instead. For divs where this rule must be broken, you should add a "display:inline" declaration to the div's rule to tame a bug where some versions of Internet Explorer double the margin.

3) Since classes can be used multiple times in a document (and an element can also have multiple classes applied), the columns have been assigned class names instead of IDs. For example, two sidebar divs could be stacked if necessary. These can very easily be changed to IDs if that's your preference, as long as you'll only be using them once per document.

4) If you prefer your nav on the right instead of the left, simply float these columns the opposite direction (all right instead of all left) and they'll render in reverse order. There's no need to move the divs around in the HTML source.

Although Kay Thompson declined to participate, Hilary Knight did. Mr. Knight designed some special anniversary pictures of Eloise.

    <p>The Plaza, home of Eloise is located in New York City at Fifth Avenue at Central Park South. Designed by famed architect Henry Janeway Hardenbergh, "the greatest hotel in the world" opened October 1, 1907. Built on the site of a 15-year-old predecessor of the same name, no expense was spared on the 19-story, French Renaissance "ch√¢teau." Marble lobbies, solid mahogany doors, 1,650 crystal chandeliers, Swiss organdy curtains, privately manufactured Irish linens, and gold-encrusted china were just a few of its features. And now, as a member of America's Family of Grand Hotels, The Fairmont Hotels, this National and City Historic Landmark structure is once again as it was always meant to be ...the premier hotel of New York. Listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Two years after the first Eloise book's publication, a painting by Knight was hung in the lobby of the hotel. "We've had generations of mothers bringing daughters or grandmothers bringing granddaughters to the hotel to see the portrait or go to the Palm Court to have tea," Curt Gathje, the Plaza's manager of the office of the president and unofficial house historian said. </p>
    <h2>Recent years</h2>
    <p>
On March 1, 2008, The Plaza Hotel reopened, following a $400 million renovation.  Eloise‚Äôs portrait is returned to its original spot outside the Palm Court restaurant.  The new Eloise shop opened the following year in the newly remodeled Plaza Hotel.  It is 2100 square feet, much larger than any previous Eloise shops.Two years later, in July, 2010, the Eloise Suite opens in room 1832 at The Plaza Hotel, designed by Betsy Johnson.  In the past, there have been Eloise Suites, however, this is the first time one was available for bookings.  Rates start at $995 per night.
